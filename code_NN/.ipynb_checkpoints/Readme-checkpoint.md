# Implementation of the forwardfeed neural network using stachastic gradient descent via backpropagation.

You will do the coding in these files: `math_util.py` and `nn.py`. 


## One real-world data set in CSV format: `MNIST` -- the handwriting single digits. 

The provided notebook already provides the necessary data preparation work, unless you want to have your own notebook for testing.

Reminder and suggestion: 

- When you read in the data set into numpy array, do not misalign/mess up the samples and their labels. 

- When you randomly shuffle the each data set (in sub-project 2), do not misalign/mess up the samples and their labels.

- An easy way to read in CSV files is to use the `Pandas` library. 



## Sub-project 1

Finish the following function in the `MyMath` class: `tanh`, `logis`, `iden`, and `relu`. Test them to ensure they do what they are supposed to do.

Finish the following function in the `NeuralNetwork` class: `add_layer`, `_init_weights`.
